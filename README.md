INTRODUCTION

Education is an important asset to all, as it provides fundamental skills to live a better life. This analysis seeks to determine which factors optimize the standardized mathematics and readings test scores for children in schools. Standardized testing of students in the United States is now 150 years old, and in 2001 No Child Left Behind education reform was implemented for state-mandated standardized testing as a means of assessing a school’s performance. Now most students are tested each year of grade school.
This analysis will look at several factors that may or may not have an impact in the pupils’ exam results. The main factor focused in this analysis will be in relation to class size and whether it has an impact on the outcome of the test scores or not. Some other factors that are looked at are years of the teacher’s teaching experience, the ethnicity of the student, and whether the student is a participant of the free lunch program.
By performing different data mining techniques, the goal is to gather clear answers and to either give recommendations for achieving the best English, and Mathematics scores or to answer a few questions about whether the following factors affect student’s standardized test score, Class Size (small, regular, or regular with teacher’s assistant), teaching experience, poverty level based on student being a recipient of free lunch, and is ethnicity (white, black, or other) a factor that affects test scores .

RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

Students really benefit from the personalized attention that they can receive when in a smaller class room. 
The most at risk students are the ones that come from economically struggling families, where private school or tutoring is not even an option. 
Caucasian students tend to have better test scores than black and other students.
